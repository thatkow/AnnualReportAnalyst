You will be given a list of ITEM strings taken from a single section of an
income statement. The list will appear **below this prompt**.

Your task is to group ITEMs that refer to the same underlying income-statement
concept and return a JSON object where:

• each key is the canonical merged ITEM name, and
• each value is the list of original ITEM strings that map to that group.

TEXT NORMALISATION RULES
──────────────────────────────

Treat two ITEMs as equivalent if they match after:

• Case-insensitive comparison
• Singular vs plural equivalence
• Minor word reordering
• Normalising punctuation:
    hyphens, commas, slashes, unicode apostrophes, parentheses
• Normalising unicode hyphens (–, —, − → -)
• Collapsing "&" vs "AND"
• Space-insensitive comparisons
• Treating PROFIT/(LOSS) vs (LOSS)/PROFIT as equivalent formatting

Ignore cosmetic suffixes such as:
• “FOR THE YEAR”
• “NET OF TAX”
• “ATTRIBUTABLE TO …”
• “FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS” (unless meaning changes)
• “BEFORE TAX” vs “PRE-TAX” (equivalent)
• “AFTER TAX” vs “POST-TAX” (equivalent)

──────────────────────────────
INCOME-STATEMENT FINANCIAL RULES
──────────────────────────────

Merge items only if the underlying **income-statement meaning is identical**.

Examples that SHOULD merge (same economic meaning):

• COST OF REVENUE  
  = COST OF REVENUES

• NET PROFIT  
  = NET PROFIT AFTER TAX  
  = NET PROFIT/(LOSS) BEFORE TAX (if PROFIT version only)  
  (**Only merge when the direction Profit vs Loss is consistent**)

• OPERATING INCOME  
  = OPERATING SURPLUS

• SALES AND MARKETING  
  = SALES & MARKETING

• FINANCE EXPENSE  
  = INTEREST EXPENSE  
  = FINANCE COSTS

• FINANCE INCOME  
  = INTEREST INCOME  
  = NET INTEREST INCOME (if meaning is net finance income)

• OTHER INCOME  
  = OTHER OPERATING INCOME  
  = OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES (if net amount is income-side)

Examples that should NOT merge:

• NET PROFIT ≠ NET LOSS  
  (direction changes the meaning)

• GROSS PROFIT ≠ OPERATING PROFIT  
• OPERATING EXPENSES ≠ OTHER EXPENSES  
• INCOME TAX EXPENSE ≠ INCOME TAX CREDIT  
• REVENUE ≠ OTHER INCOME  
• FINANCE INCOME ≠ FINANCE EXPENSE

──────────────────────────────
CANONICAL KEY RULE
──────────────────────────────

For each equivalence group:

• The key must be the cleanest, shortest, punctuation-neutral version
  of the economic concept.

Examples:
• “OPERATING INCOME”
• “NET LOSS”
• “INCOME TAX EXPENSE”
• “SALES AND MARKETING”
• “FINANCE EXPENSE”

OUTPUT FORMAT
──────────────────────────────

Return ONLY a JSON object in this format:

{
  "canonical_item_1": ["original1", "original2", ...],
  "canonical_item_2": ["original3", ...],
  ...
}

No explanation. No markdown. JSON only.
