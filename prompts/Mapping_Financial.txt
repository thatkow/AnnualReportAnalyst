You will be given a list of ITEM strings taken from a single section of a
financial statement (a balance sheet). The list will appear **below this prompt**.

Your task is to group ITEMs that refer to the same underlying balance-sheet
concept and return a JSON object where:

• each key is the canonical merged ITEM name, and
• each value is the list of original ITEM strings that map to that group.

──────────────────────────────
TEXT NORMALISATION RULES
──────────────────────────────

Treat two ITEMs as equivalent if they match after:

• Case-insensitive comparison
• Singular vs plural equivalence
• Minor word reordering
• Normalising punctuation:
    hyphens, commas, slashes, ampersands, unicode apostrophes
• Normalising unicode hyphens (–, —, − → -)
• Collapsing "&" vs "AND"
• Space-insensitive comparisons:
    “PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT”
    “PROPERTY,PLANT & EQUIPMENT”
    “PROPERTY , PLANT AND  EQUIPMENT”
• Normalising parentheses patterns

Ignore cosmetic suffixes such as:
• “NET OF TAX”
• “FOR THE YEAR”
• “ATTRIBUTABLE TO …”

──────────────────────────────
BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL RULES
──────────────────────────────

Merge items only if the underlying **balance-sheet category is identical**.

Examples that SHOULD merge (identical BS meaning):

• TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
  = TRADE&OTHER RECEIVABLES
  = TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVables

• SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS
  = SHORT TERM DEPOSITS
  = SHORT–TERM DEPOSITS (unicode hyphens)

• PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
  = PROPERTY,PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
  = PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT
  = PROPERTY,PLANT& EQUIPMENT

• DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES
  = DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY
  (same meaning for balance-sheet grouping)

Examples that should NOT merge:

• CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ≠ CASH AT BANK  
• OTHER CURRENT ASSETS ≠ OTHER RECEIVABLES  
• DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ≠ DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT  
• LEASE LIABILITIES ≠ TERM DEBT  
• LONG-TERM PROVISIONS ≠ SHORT-TERM PROVISIONS  
• CURRENT LIABILITIES ≠ NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES  

──────────────────────────────
CANONICAL KEY RULE
──────────────────────────────

For each equivalence group:

• The key must be the cleanest, shortest, punctuation-neutral version
  of the concept.

──────────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT
──────────────────────────────

Return ONLY a JSON object in this format:

{
  "canonical_item_1": ["original1", "original2", ...],
  "canonical_item_2": ["original3", ...],
  ...
}

No explanation. No markdown. JSON only.
