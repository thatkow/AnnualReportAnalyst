You are parsing an "Income Statement" (also called "Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income").

Task:
1. Before extracting numbers, determine whether the statement specifies a presentation scale such as "Amounts in thousands", "USD millions", "€m", "AUD $ million", etc.
   - Treat "thousand"/"000" → multiply every numeric value by 1,000.
   - Treat "million"/"m" → multiply by 1,000,000.
   - Treat "billion"/"bn" → multiply by 1,000,000,000.
   - If multiple scales appear, use the clearest instruction attached to the income statement table (e.g., "($ in millions)" overrides a generic report-wide note).
   - If no clear scale is stated, do not multiply (use factor 1).
   - Apply the factor to every numeric cell you output, including negatives and subtotals. Leave blanks blank.

2. Extract the Income Statement into one tab-separated table with these columns: CATEGORY, ITEM, and one column per date in format DD.MM.YYYY.
   - Include EVERY visible row in the statement, including section headers and subtotals (e.g., GROSS PROFIT, TOTAL EXPENSES, OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EPS lines).
   - If the statement spans multiple pages or columns, continue across all pages/columns until the true end of the statement. Read left-to-right within a page panel, then top-to-bottom.

3. Extraction rules:
   - ITEM must always contain the exact line text from the statement (do not drop or replace with 0).
   - If a label wraps across lines, join with a single space; remove hyphenation at line breaks (e.g., "operat-" + "ing" → "operating").
   - Remove footnote markers (superscripts, asterisks, bracketed note numbers) from ITEM text only.
   - CATEGORY is optional: if you cannot confidently classify, leave CATEGORY blank (never write 0).
   - Use broad categories if possible:
     • REVENUE → sales, cost of goods sold, gross profit/margin
     • EXPENSES → all expense lines, including "total expenses"
     • OPERATING → operating profit/loss, finance costs, FX, other income
     • TAX → tax benefit/expense
     • TOTAL → net profit/loss, total comprehensive income
     • OTHER → "other comprehensive income"
     • CURRENCY → foreign currency translation
     • SHARES → share information
     • FINANCIALS → denomination
   - If you don’t know the category, leave CATEGORY as UNKNOWN, but ITEM must always be present.

4. Formatting for date columns (Columns other than CATEGORY and ITEM):
   - Remove commas from numbers before applying the scale factor.
   - Convert parentheses into negatives (then apply the factor).
   - Treat dashes (–, —, -) as 0 only when they appear in numeric cells (then apply the factor).
   - If no value is shown, leave cell blank (not 0).

5. Output rules:
   - Use exactly one tab as the separator.
   - Convert CATEGORY and ITEM text to UPPER CASE and remove any commas or tabs from those texts.
   - Output one table, starting with headers.
   - Do not output explanations, just the table.
