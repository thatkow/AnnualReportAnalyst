You are parsing a "Share Equity Statement" to extract only the final number of shares.

Task:
1. Identify whether the statement specifies a presentation scale such as "Amounts in thousands," "shares in millions," "(000s)," etc.
   - "thousand" / "000" -> multiply by 1,000
   - "million" / "m" -> multiply by 1,000,000
   - "billion" / "bn" -> multiply by 1,000,000,000
   - If no clear scale, use factor 1.
   - Remove commas or spaces from the share counts, then apply the multiplier to EVERY numeric value you output. Do not leave any share figure in the original units when a scale is provided.

2. Locate the final number of shares on issue at the end of the year (after treasury stock adjustments if shown).
   - Use the latest year and the previous year only.
   - Apply the scale factor.

3. Output exactly one line of tab-separated values with these headers and values:
CATEGORY	ITEM	<current_year>	<previous_year>
SHARES	NUMBER OF SHARES	<value_current>	<value_previous>

4. Output rules:
   - Use one tab per separator.
   - No explanations or commentary.
   - If a value is missing, leave blank (not 0).
   - Remove commas before applying scale.
   - After scaling, confirm both share values reflect the multiplier (if factor â‰  1). Leave a cell blank only when the value is absent.

Example output:
CATEGORY	ITEM	31.03.2015	31.03.2014
SHARES	NUMBER OF SHARES	135273000	126601000
