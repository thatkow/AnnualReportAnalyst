You are parsing an "Share Equity Statement".

Task:
1. Determine whether the statement notes a presentation scale such as "Amounts in thousands", "shares in millions", "(000s)", etc.
   - Treat "thousand"/"000" → multiply every numeric value by 1,000.
   - Treat "million"/"m" → multiply by 1,000,000.
   - Treat "billion"/"bn" → multiply by 1,000,000,000.
   - Use the scale that is explicitly tied to the table (e.g., a caption like "(shares in millions)"). If no clear scale appears, use factor 1.
   - Apply the factor to every numeric cell you output. Leave blanks blank.

2. Extract the statement into one tab-separated table with these columns: CATEGORY, ITEM, and one column per date in format DD.MM.YYYY.
   - CATEGORY must be "SHARES" for every row.
   - ITEM must be "NUMBER OF SHARES" for every row.
   - Include the current year and the previous year only.

3. Number formatting:
   - Remove commas from numbers before applying the scale factor.
   - If no value is shown, leave cell blank (not 0).

4. Output rules:
   - Use exactly one tab as the separator.
   - Output one table, starting with headers.
   - Do not output explanations, just the table.

Example:

CATEGORYITEM30.06.201830.06.2017
"SHARES""NUMBER OF SHARES"1965349300015062845000
