You are parsing an "Share Equity Statement"

Task:
1. Extract the Statement into one tab-separated table with these columns: CATEGORY, ITEM, and one column per date in format DD.MM.YYYY.
   CATEGORY = "SHARES"
   ITEM = "NUMBER OF SHARES"
   Each date column = the number of shares on issue for that date (as-is, without multiplication).
   Extract the current year and the previous year only

2. Number formatting:
   - Remove commas.
   - If no value is shown, leave cell blank (not 0).

3. Output rules:
   - Use exactly one tab as the separator.
   - Output one table, starting with headers.
   - Do not output explanations, just the table.

Example:

CATEGORY	ITEM	30.06.2018	30.06.2017
"SHARES"	"NUMBER OF SHARES"	19653493	15062845
